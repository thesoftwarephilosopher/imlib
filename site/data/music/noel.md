> The First Noel, the Angels did say  
> Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
> In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
> On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> They looked up and saw a star  
> Shining in the East beyond them far  
> And to the earth it gave great light  
> And so it continued both day and night.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> And by the light of that same star  
> Three Wise men came from country far  
> To seek for a King was their intent  
> And to follow the star wherever it went.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> This star drew nigh to the northwest  
> O'er Bethlehem it took its rest  
> And there it did both pause and stay  
> Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> Then entered in those Wise men three  
> Full reverently upon their knee  
> And offered there in His presence  
> Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!   
>   
> Then let us all with one accord  
> Sing praises to our heavenly Lord  
> That hath made Heaven and earth of nought  
> And with his blood mankind has bought.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!
